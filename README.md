# MaptyAppJS

## **_Description_**

This application showcases OOP using vanilla JS and the Leaflet Library

## **_Features_**

- loads a map location based off user's browser information, geolocation and Leaflet
- allows users to click a part of the map in order to create a running or cycling workout and subsequently drop a pin in that location on the map
- changing the workout in the dropdown will change the tab color of the workout and the information in the form
- workouts are rendered in a list on the left portion of the screen
- workout pins are rendered on the map
- clicking a workout from the workout list will pan the map view to the workout's pin
- workouts created are saved in local storage in the browser

## **_Known Issues/Potential Updates_**

_Due to the nature of the application really only being created to showcase OOP in vanilla JS some features are purposefully omitted._

- I would like to add full CRUD functionality to the workouts and link them to a database
- I would like to add the ability to drop a placeholder pin before the workout is created
- Adding authentication and authorization could be a future goal

## **_Setup_**

simply copy this repo into the desired directory on your local system and open it with your favorite editor. My recommended method to run the app is to use Live Server from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and right click the index.html file to start a live server.
